Context on Hurricane Situation in Jamaica:

Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on October 28, 2025, as a catastrophic Category 5 storm, the strongest hurricane ever to hit the island. It brought sustained winds up to 175 mph and gusts up to 215 mph, causing immense destruction particularly in the southwestern regions near Black River and areas such as Hanover, Westmoreland, Saint James, and Saint Elizabeth. The storm delivered torrential rains with forecasts up to 30 inches, a storm surge of 9 to 13 feet in places, widespread flooding, landslides, and severe wind damage including roof loss and structural failures, especially in poorly built homes.

Critical impacts include significant damage to infrastructure, extensive power outages affecting about 77% of the island, major disruptions to transportation and communication networks, and flooding leading to community isolation. Emergency services have ordered mandatory evacuations in vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas, with primary emergency shelters opened but underutilized. The storm also severely affected access to clean water, sanitation, hygiene, and food, with UNICEF reporting challenges for at least 250,000 children.

The Jamaican government declared a national disaster zone, and international aid agencies, including the American Red Cross, Americares, CARE, Direct Relief, and others, are actively mobilizing to provide humanitarian relief such as food, medical supplies, shelter, and emergency support. Cash donations are recommended to avoid logistical bottlenecks, and multiple organizations are coordinating relief efforts on the ground.

In summary, Hurricane Melissa is a historic and devastating natural disaster for Jamaica, causing catastrophic damage with a lengthy recovery ahead, supported by local and international humanitarian efforts.[^1][^3][^4][^6][^10]
