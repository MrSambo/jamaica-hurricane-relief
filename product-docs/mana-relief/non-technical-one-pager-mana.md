# **Mana Relief Platform – Non-Technical One-Pager**

### **Purpose**

Disaster relief donations often lack transparency, speed, or local impact. In Jamaica, after a major hurricane, supporters at home and abroad want to help, but fear that cash gifts disappear or take too long to reach those in need. At the same time, Jamaican shops and distributors—even those with capacity—are rarely mobilized as primary supply partners.

### **The Problem**

* **Lack of Public Confidence:** Donors want to send items, not just money, but can’t see how funds are used or track results.

* **Wasted Local Capacity:** Many local businesses have relief goods in stock but aren’t coordinated into the response.

* **Inefficient, Complex Channels:** International platforms are too generic; local donation drives lack credibility with global givers.

### **Our Solution**

Mana is a user-friendly, transparent online platform that:

* **Publishes real-time lists of urgently needed relief items** (water, food, hygiene, etc.), with quantity goals and trusted supplier info.

* **Allows anyone, anywhere to fund those items directly—first through Jamaican suppliers** (Shop Local), or via Amazon when necessary (fallback).

* **Partners with established Jamaican businesses** and NGOs, onboarding suppliers personally for trust and reliability.

* **Tracks and verifies every fulfillment**: photos, receipts, and progress updates are posted for donors and the public.

* **Keeps everything visible, simple, fast, and truly local-first.**

### **Challenges We’ve Tackled**

* **Supplier Verification:** Manual onboarding, personal conversations, and document checks for every listed supplier—no anonymous listings.

* **Legal and Compliance:** Working with local NGOs and advisors to ensure foreign donations, affiliate income, and payout flows meet legal requirements.

* **Local vs. Foreign Sourcing:** Shop Local is always prioritized, maximizing the Jamaican economic impact and trust; Amazon is only a fallback for otherwise unavailable items.

* **Real-Time Transparency:** Every donation is matched with proof-of-order and delivery, building donor confidence and public trust.

* **Stakeholder Alignment:** Frequent communication with all partners (NGOs, businesses, government agencies as needed) for shared goals and expectations.

### **Outcomes**

* **Donors get clear answers:** See exactly what you funded, who supplied it, and the real outcome on the ground.

* **Local business powers the recovery:** Relief brings business to trusted Jamaican companies.

* **Response is agile and scalable:** Small team, clear process, and digital-first simplicity mean we can move quickly and adapt, even as crises evolve.

**Mana’s vision:**  

A Jamaica-led, globally-supported relief engine that matches generosity with accountability, drives real local recovery, and can serve as a model for Caribbean and global disaster response.
