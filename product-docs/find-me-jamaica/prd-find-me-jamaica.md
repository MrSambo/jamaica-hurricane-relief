## Workflows Inventory

### Main Use Cases

1. **Image-Based Missing Person Report**

  * **Trigger:** Family member cannot locate relative after disaster

  * **Process:** Citizen uploads photo → submits report with location (parish/town) → receives confirmation → gets real-time match notifications

  * **Outcome:** Case created and entered into facial recognition matching system

2. **Found Person Registration**

  * **Trigger:** Individual found or sheltered person needs identification

  * **Process:** Volunteer/organization uploads photo with location → system processes facial recognition matches → real-time notifications sent

  * **Outcome:** Potential reunification initiated through image matching

3. **Automated Facial Recognition Processing**

  * **Trigger:** System identifies potential match above confidence threshold

  * **Process:** Facial recognition flags match → human verification queue → volunteer reviews → match confirmation/rejection

  * **Outcome:** Verified match triggers real-time notifications and case progression

4. **Volunteer Case Assignment**

  * **Trigger:** New case requires investigation or verification

  * **Process:** Case appears in volunteer dashboard by location → volunteer claims case → assignment confirmed → investigation begins

  * **Outcome:** Active case management with regular status updates

5. **Batch Image Import**

  * **Trigger:** Partner organization needs to upload multiple photos and records

  * **Process:** Organization uploads batch images with metadata → system validates data → facial recognition processing

  * **Outcome:** Multiple cases created or updated with automated matching

### Edge Cases

1. **Duplicate Report Detection**

  * **Trigger:** Multiple reports for same missing person

  * **Process:** Facial recognition identifies potential duplicates → admin review → merge confirmed duplicates

  * **Outcome:** Single case with comprehensive information from multiple sources

2. **False Match Rejection**

  * **Trigger:** Facial recognition suggests incorrect match

  * **Process:** Volunteer reviews match → determines incorrect → rejects with reasoning → system learns

  * **Outcome:** Improved matching algorithms and avoided incorrect notifications

3. **Contact Information Update**

  * **Trigger:** Reporter needs to change notification preferences or contact info

  * **Process:** Reporter uses case ID to access record → updates contact information → system validates

  * **Outcome:** Continued real-time notifications to correct contact information

4. **Emergency Platform Activation**

  * **Trigger:** Official emergency declaration requires platform activation

  * **Process:** ODPEM initiates activation → system scales resources → public notification → monitoring engaged

  * **Outcome:** Platform ready for disaster response within defined timeframes

## Image Processing and Location Handling

### Facial Recognition Workflow

**Batch Processing:**

* Organizations upload multiple images with location metadata (parish/town/details)

* Each image processed through facial recognition system

* Automated matching against missing person database

* Quality assurance checks for image clarity and metadata accuracy

**Individual Submission:**

* Reporters upload photos through mobile interface

* Location captured as parish/town with optional specific details

* Image optimization for mobile connectivity and storage efficiency

* Immediate facial recognition processing for matching

### Location Specification System

**Location Hierarchy:**

* Parish (required)

* Town/Community (required)

* Specific details (optional - landmark, address, coordinates)

**Location Verification:**

* Cross-reference with known shelter locations and emergency zones

* Geographic validation against Jamaica mapping data

* Multiple location sources reconciliation for accuracy improvement

## Communication and Notification System

### Real-Time Multi-Channel Notifications

**SMS Notifications:**

* Primary channel for immediate alerts

* Works with basic mobile phones and limited connectivity

* Real-time delivery for facial recognition matches

* Delivery confirmation tracking

**Email Notifications:**

* Detailed information including matched images when appropriate

* Links to platform for full case details and status updates

* Real-time notifications for verified matches

* Backup channel when SMS fails

**Privacy and Safety Protocols:**

* Contact information encrypted and access-controlled

* Used exclusively for case-related notifications

* Automatic purging after emergency period conclusion

* No contact information sharing without explicit consent

## Matching and Verification Logic

### Facial Recognition System

**Matching Process:**

* Primary matching method using uploaded photos

* Confidence scoring with defined thresholds

* Cross-reference with location data (parish/town)

* Real-time processing for immediate notifications

**Confidence Threshold Management:**

* High Confidence (>85%): Automatic notification pending administrative confirmation

* Medium Confidence (60-85%): Requires manual verification by trained volunteers

* Low Confidence (<60%): Placed in manual review queue; no automatic notification

**Manual Verification:**

* Volunteers and administrators perform manual verification of medium and low-confidence matches

### Manual Review Process

**Verification Workflow:**

* Trained volunteers review matches above threshold

* Multi-factor verification using available information

* Contact with reporters/found persons when appropriate and safe

* Documentation of verification decision and reasoning

## Platform Requirements

### Data Privacy and Security

* All personal data encrypted at rest and in transit

* Access controls prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive information

* Data retention policies automatically purge information after emergency period

* User consent mechanisms for data collection and facial recognition processing

### Operational Guardrails

* Human verification required for all potential matches before family notification

* Multi-level approval workflows for case status changes and reunification confirmations

* System prevents duplicate case creation through intelligent deduplication

* Emergency data governance protocols maintain privacy while enabling coordination

### Performance Standards

* 95% of missing person reports processed within 15 minutes during peak periods

* Real-time facial recognition processing and notifications

* Platform maintains functionality with degraded connectivity down to 2G networks

* System supports concurrent processing of 1,000+ reports in first 24 hours

### UX and Accessibility Considerations

* Interface designed for compassionate, stress-reducing communication.

* Use clear, empathetic tone and avoid technical jargon.

* Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for contrast, text scaling, and screen reader compatibility.

* Minimize visual clutter and ensure intuitive navigation.

* Provide reassuring feedback messages at all key steps (e.g., confirmation of report submission).

## Error Handling and User Messaging Guidelines

**Principles:**
* Use empathetic, human-centered language in all error messages and notifications.
* Avoid technical jargon; provide actionable steps or reassurance instead.
* Display clear and visible feedback during data submission and processing.

**Examples:**
* “We couldn’t upload your photo right now. Please try again in a few minutes.” (instead of “Upload failed.”)
* “We’re having trouble processing your request. Your data is safe, and you’ll be notified as soon as it’s resolved.”

**Dashboard and Admin Context:**
* Use concise alerts for validation errors and verification conflicts.
* Provide context-sensitive help and recovery options (e.g., retry upload, reassign verification).
* Include gentle tone in admin alerts to maintain clarity without alarm.
